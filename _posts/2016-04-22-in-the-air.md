Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, multirotor Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), balloons, blimps and dirigibles,rockets, pigeons, kites, parachutes, stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles. Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.'

**Aerial photography** is the taking of photographs of the ground from an elevated/direct-down position. Usually the camera is not supported by a ground-based structure. Platforms for aerial photography include fixed-wing [aircraft][0], [helicopters][1], [multirotor Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)][2], [balloons][3], [blimps][4] and [dirigibles][5],[rockets][6], [pigeons][7], [kites][8], [parachutes][9], stand-alone telescoping and vehicle-mounted poles. Mounted cameras may be triggered remotely or automatically; hand-held photographs may be taken by a photographer.

Aerial photography should not be confused with [air-to-air photography][10], where one or more aircraft are used as [chase planes][11] that "chase" and photograph other aircraft in flight.
