Each year, more than 4 billion pounds of toxicchemicals are released into the environment; these toxic chemicals can accumulate in your body and affect overall health. Long-term exposure to even small amounts of these substances has been linked to a number of unwelcome health effects. Under normal circumstances, your body is able to rid itself of harmful chemicals andpollutants. But sometimes, the sheer volume of toxins to which you are exposed can overwhelm natural processes and accumulate in your tissues. Add to that an unhealthy diet lacking in proper nutrients, and the problem can get even worse.  

The Clear Change Program is designed to enhance the body's natural metabolic detoxification process while providing adequate fuel for both cleansing and other daily activities. Getting healthier is important --- and so is feeling your best. The Clear Change Program will show you how to do both. Get started today!

### Choosing the Right UltraClear Formula

UltraClear formulas were introduced over 20 years ago and are a driving force behind the growing awareness of the benefits of metabolic detoxification. These premier, research-based formulas have a long history of successful clinical use and are strategically designed to offer different levels of support to meet individual needs for more successful outcomes. For example, UltraClear Plus pH features the same exceptional macro- and micronutrient profile as UltraClear Plus, but with added nutrients designed to promote an alkaline urinary pH status.\*

The charts below are designed to help you and your healthcare practitioner make the appropriate product choice to meet individual needs.

The Clear Change 28-Day Program provides a more comprehensive approach to metabolic detoxification than the 10-day program. It's an easy-to-follow program that will help patients get on track to feel better and more energized. Many people benefit from completing a 28-day metabolic detoxification program once or twice a year.
