**Acid-Alkaline Balance**

Proper health starts with the correct acid-alkaline balance in your body. The pH level (acid - alkaline measurement in pH) of our internal fluids affects every cell in our bodies. Extended acid imbalances of any kind can overwhelm your body, and lead to health complications.

Just as the body regulates its temperature in a rigid manner, so will it manage to preserve a very narrow pH range - especially in the blood. As a matter of fact, the body will go to such great lengths to maintain a blood pH of 7.365 that it will even create stress on other tissues, body systems, and organs to do so. Chronic acidity will interrupt all cellular activities and functions - it interferes with life itself.

When the pH of the body gets out of balance (too acidic), we may experience low energy, fatigue, excess weight, poor digestion, aches and pains, and even more serious disorders.

The cycle of acidity begins primarily as a result of three things:

1\. Ingesting acids. Eating too many acidifying foods like processed sugar, meats, dairy, coffee, alcohol, etc. Create an acid ash in the body. These acids can overload the body's ability to neutralize them.

2\. Creation of acids. Pathogens and microforms create acidifying toxins in the body. As the body becomes more and more acidic, bad bacteria, yeasts and other microforms proliferate in the body. Since these organisms are living, they eat as well as create resulting toxins. These toxins are often very acidifying.

3\. Improper elimination of acids. Not all acids are the same; some are weak and some are strong. Weak acids like citric acid are much easier to neutralize than strong acids like uric acid. The body uses many systems in order to buffer acids including breath, mineral reserves, and fat. When the body's buffering systems become compromised, excess acids build up.

The process of reestablishing an acid-alkaline balance begins with building proper diet and nutrition into a daily lifestyle. These healthy changes include eating alkalizing foods (vegetables, low sugar fruits, etc.) and attaining super hydration by drinking plenty of alkaline water that is ionic, re-structured and filled with antioxidants like the water that comes from an electric water ionizer for the home.
