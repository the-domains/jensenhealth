# Electric and Magnetic Fields

Electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) are invisible areas of energy, often referred to as radiation , that are associated with the use of electrical power and various forms of natural and man-made lighting. EMFs are typically characterized by wavelength or frequency into one of two radioactive categories:

* Non-ionizing: low-level radiation which is generally perceived as harmless to humans
* Ionizing: high-level radiation which has the potential for cellular and DNA damage
